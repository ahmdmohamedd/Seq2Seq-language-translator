# Seq2Seq-language-translator
This project implements an English-to-French language translator using a Seq2Seq model with LSTM architecture in TensorFlow. It preprocesses text data through tokenization and padding, enabling variable-length input and output. Users can input English sentences, and the model will output the corresponding French translations.
